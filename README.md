# Plant Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning and Computer Vision

This project aims to predict plant diseases using machine learning techniques and computer vision. By leveraging image processing algorithms and trained machine learning models, the system can accurately identify diseases affecting plants based on images of their leaves.

## Features

- **Image Processing**: Utilizes computer vision techniques to preprocess and extract features from plant leaf images.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Employs various machine learning algorithms such as SVM, Random Forest, or CNNs to classify plant diseases based on extracted features.
- **Prediction Accuracy**: Provides accurate predictions of plant diseases, helping farmers take timely actions to mitigate crop damage.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Offers a user-friendly interface for uploading images and viewing disease predictions.

## Installation
