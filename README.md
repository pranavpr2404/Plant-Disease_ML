## Plant Disease Prediction using Machine Learning and Computer Vision

This project aims to develop a predictive model for identifying plant diseases using machine learning techniques and computer vision. The dataset used for training and testing the model was obtained from Kaggle.

### Project Overview:
- **Dataset:** The dataset contains images of various plant species affected by different diseases. Each image is labeled with the corresponding disease.
- **Objective:** The goal is to train a machine learning model to accurately classify images of plants as healthy or diseased and, if diseased, predict the specific disease.
- **Approach:** The project utilizes computer vision techniques to extract features from plant images and machine learning algorithms for classification.
- **Tools and Technologies:** Python programming language, libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV are used for image processing, model development, and evaluation.
- **Model Evaluation:** The model's performance is evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Repository Structure:
- **`data/`:** Contains the dataset obtained from Kaggle.
- **`notebooks/`:** Jupyter notebooks detailing data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **`src/`:** Python scripts for implementing machine learning models and image processing techniques.
- **`results/`:** Stores the model evaluation results and any visualizations generated during the analysis.

### Getting Started:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd plant-disease-prediction`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory for detailed analysis and implementation.
